    <h2 style="font-size:46px; margin-bottom:20px; margin-top:50px;">History of the Tech Space</h2>
    <div class="aCont">
<span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:300; color:#54f5ff;">Phase 1</span>
    <br>Phase 1 was essentially building a smarter more cost effective wood shop. As Eastside Prep was founded with a project based curriculum. In 2007 we first built a fabrication lab (no digital tools at that time). We had some wood working tools and soldering irons. We made snow shoes out of PVC and later conduit. Our most ambitious project being a summer camp where students built their own canvas kayaks. The original idea was that it would be a resource space that could be reserved by a class who was doing a project. While this did in fact happen, it didn’t happen to the degree that we hoped.
<br><br>
<span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:300; color:#54f5ff;">Phase 2 </span>
    <br>Phase 2 began in February 2010, when we ordered a makerbot cupcake cnc and began our journey into the modern conception of a makerspace. In 2011, we started exploring Seattle Maker Spaces and even laser cut our logo for TEDxEastsidePrep at Metrix CreateSpace. we were hooked on the concept. In March of 2012, we purchased a 40w Epilog Zing laser cutter with some left over budget (11K) and found that it was hugely more useful than the 3D printer.
<br><br>
<span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:300; color:#54f5ff;">Phase 3 </span>
    <br>Phase 3 began with us figuring out how to increase student involvement. Our school has a trips week and we built a trip on campus to teach students about the makerspace tools we had, we followed that up with a summer session as well. We also launched an Upper School course called Physical Meets Digital. In our initial year we had 50 students (nearly a quarter of the school) enrolled. We used the fees for that trip to fund our first (other than the laser cutter) investment in maker tools. In February of 2013 we bought a cubify and where hugely impressed for a month until we received our makerBot Replicator 2. The replicator 2 was an amazing device and it is our longest running 3D printer. In 2013 we also purchased a roland vinyl cutter and later a replicator 2x. Additionally, we dove into the world of Arduinos. Our confidence was further bolstered as made our own donor tiles for a new building at a cost of 2K vs. the quoted 20K from the sign company effectively paying the school back for every dollar spent so far on the maker space.
<br><br>
<span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:300; color:#54f5ff;">Phase 4 </span>
    <br>Phase 4 was a step back in the sense that we had to move out of our existing space and into a temporary one. We also started an FTC robotics team. While the space was less ideal than previously, we did see considerable use driven in part by the FTC program. We also continued to run the Make@EPS trip program (though did not run summer programs that year). We also bought a printrBot metal simple at that time which was the first quality 3D printer we found for sub $1,000 and the LittleBits classroom electronics set.
<br><br>
<span style="font-size:24px; font-weight:300; color:#54f5ff;">Phase 5 </span>
    <br>
        Phase 5 is what we are in now. We built a space that fits the philosophy of the technology department and maker program. We bought a few fancy tools and started a trimester required class called MAKE for 6th graders. On the tool side we bought a second laser cutter (Universal PLS.100d) a CNC wood router (ShopBot PRS96). Part way through the term, our replicator 2x started to bite the dust and we were having trouble keeping up with demand so we bought 4 printrBot plays and a printrBot plus. Phase 5 also ushered in a new era of student leadership. We now have upper school student TAs for our 6th grade MAKE class. We also have certification levels on all of our tools and students performing much of the weekly maintenance.</div>
